# Trachtenberg's method of multiplication by 3

Trachtenberg's methods are useful for mental calculation because it's very simple, but it's not very efficient for computers. But I decided to implement it in C to improve my programming skill. 
Notions used : 
- loops (for and while)
- function
- get each digits of a integer number
